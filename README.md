# Image_Texture_Segmentation

* Obtain an accurate representation of image texture information

* Use SLICO algorithm to oversegment the images into 600 superpixels

* Compute Gabor texture features for all images with different scales and orientations

* Use kmeans algorithm to group the superpixels into a number of clusters

* Cluster the superpixels again, taking into account the superpixels in the neighborhood defined

* Show the final clustering on the actual images
